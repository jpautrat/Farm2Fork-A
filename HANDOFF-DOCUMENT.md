- Routes defining API endpoints
- Middleware for authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- Services for external integrations
- Utils for shared functionality

### Frontend Structure
The frontend uses Next.js 13+ App Router with:
- App directory organizing pages by feature
- Components directory for reusable UI elements
- Store directory for Zustand state management
- Utils directory for helper functions
- Contexts for shared state across components

## Deployment Configuration

### Netlify (Frontend)
- Configuration in `netlify.toml` with:
  - Build settings pointing to the frontend directory
  - Publish directory set to `.next`
