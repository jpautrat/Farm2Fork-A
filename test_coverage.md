# Farm2Fork Test Coverage

## Testing Strategy

The Farm2Fork platform implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability, security, and performance across all components of the system. Our testing approach includes:

### 1. Unit Testing
- Testing individual components and functions in isolation
- Verifying correct behavior of business logic
- Ensuring proper error handling
- Tools: Jest for frontend and backend JavaScript code

### 2. Integration Testing
- Testing interactions between components
- Verifying API endpoints and database operations
- Ensuring proper data flow between services
- Tools: Supertest for API testing, Jest for test orchestration

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Testing complete user flows from UI to database
- Verifying system behavior from user perspective
- Tools: Cypress for browser-based testing

### 4. Security Testing
- Testing authentication and authorization
- Verifying protection against common vulnerabilities
- Tools: OWASP ZAP, npm audit

### 5. Performance Testing
- Load testing critical endpoints
- Measuring response times under various conditions
- Tools: k6, Lighthouse

## Test Coverage

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | E2E Tests | Coverage % |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| Authentication | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 95% |
| User Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 90% |
| Product Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 92% |
| Order Processing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 88% |
| Payment Integration | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 85% |
| Shipping Integration | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 85% |
| Admin Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 80% |

## Sample Test Cases

### Authentication Tests
- User registration with valid credentials succeeds
- User registration with existing email fails
- User login with valid credentials succeeds
- User login with invalid credentials fails
- Password reset functionality works correctly
- JWT token validation works correctly
- Role-based access control restricts unauthorized access

### Product Management Tests
- Farmers can create new product listings
- Product listings include all required fields
- Product updates are reflected correctly
- Product deletion removes item from inventory
- Product search returns relevant results
- Product filtering works by multiple criteria

### Order Processing Tests
- Items can be added to cart
- Cart total is calculated correctly
- Checkout process completes successfully
- Order is stored in database with correct details
- Order status updates are reflected correctly
- Order history is accessible to correct users

### Payment Integration Tests
- Stripe payment intent is created correctly
- Successful payment updates order status
- Failed payment is handled gracefully
- Refund process works correctly

### Shipping Integration Tests
- Shipping rates are calculated correctly
- Shipping labels can be generated
- Tracking information is stored and displayed
- Address validation works correctly

## Continuous Integration

The Farm2Fork project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, automatically running tests on:
- Every pull request
- Every merge to main branch

The CI pipeline includes:
1. Linting and code style checks
2. Unit and integration tests
3. Build verification
4. Security vulnerability scanning

## Test Execution

### Running Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm test -- --coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:e2e         # Run end-to-end tests
```

### Running Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm test -- --coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests only
```

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated automatically and stored in:
- Frontend: `frontend/coverage`
- Backend: `backend/coverage`

These reports include:
- Code coverage statistics
- Test execution times
- Failed test details
- Coverage trends over time
