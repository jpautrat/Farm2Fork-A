# IMPORTANT: Final Steps for Farm2Fork Project Submission

Before submitting your Farm2Fork project, please complete the following critical steps:

## 1. Convert _prompts.md to PDF

The _prompts.md file needs to be converted to PDF format and saved as _prompts.pdf. You can use one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using Online Markdown to PDF Converters

1. Open a web browser and go to one of these online converters:
   - https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
   - https://md2pdf.netlify.app/
   - https://dillinger.io/ (Export as PDF)

2. Open the _prompts.md file in a text editor
3. Copy all the content
4. Paste it into the online converter
5. Download the PDF file
6. Save it as _prompts.pdf in the project root directory

### Method 2: Using Visual Studio Code with Extensions

1. Open _prompts.md in Visual Studio Code
2. Install the "Markdown PDF" extension by yzane
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Markdown PDF"
   - Install the extension by yzane

3. Right-click in the markdown file
4. Select "Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)"
5. The PDF will be generated in the same directory
6. Rename it to _prompts.pdf if necessary

## 2. Replace Placeholder Images (Optional)

The README.md file currently uses placeholder images. For a more professional look, you can:

1. Create actual images for:
   - Farm2Fork Logo
   - Architecture Diagram
   - Database Schema Diagram
   - User Workflow Diagram
   - Screenshots of the application

2. Replace the placeholder URLs in README.md with paths to your actual images

## 3. Push to GitHub

Make sure all files are pushed to the GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add final documentation for project submission"
git push origin main
```

## 4. Verify Submission Requirements

Ensure you have:

- [x] README.md with project description, functional documentation, and visuals
- [x] _planning.md with all AI-generated non-code content
- [ ] _prompts.pdf with examples of prompts used to build the project (needs to be created)

Once these steps are completed, your Farm2Fork project will be ready for submission!
