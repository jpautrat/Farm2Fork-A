## Alternative Approach

If you don't have time to create these images, you can:

1. Use AI image generation tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion to create these images
2. Find suitable stock images or icons that represent these concepts
3. Use placeholder image services like https://placeholder.com/ with appropriate dimensions

For example, you could use:
```
![Farm2Fork Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/200x100?text=Farm2Fork+Logo)
![Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Architecture+Diagram)
```

## Important Note

Make sure to update the README.md file with the correct image paths once you've created these images.
