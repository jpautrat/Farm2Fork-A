# Farm2Fork Project Planning

## Project Overview

Farm2Fork is a full-stack e-commerce platform designed to connect local farmers directly with consumers for food delivery. The platform enables farmers to list their products, manage inventory, and process orders, while allowing consumers to browse, purchase, and receive locally-sourced food products.

2. Browse products by category
3. Search for specific products
4. Filter products by various attributes
5. Add products to cart
6. Complete checkout with payment
7. Track order status
8. View order history

### Admin Use Cases
1. Moderate new user registrations
2. Review and approve/reject product listings
3. Monitor system performance
4. Generate sales and user activity reports
5. Manage user issues and support requests

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- Next.js for server-side rendering and SEO optimization
- React components organized by feature
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- React Query for data fetching with retry mechanisms
- Internationalization with multiple language support
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features

### Backend Architecture
- Express.js RESTful API
- Middleware for authentication, logging, error handling
- Service-oriented architecture for business logic
- Data access layer for database operations
- Integration with third-party services (Stripe, EasyPost)
- Two-level caching (in-memory and Redis)
- Rate limiting system

### Database Schema
- Users table (with role differentiation)
- Farmer profiles table
- Consumer profiles table
- Products table
- Categories table
- Orders table
- Order_Items table
- Payments table
- Shipping_Details table
- Reviews table

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints for all resources
- JWT authentication for secure access
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Comprehensive error handling
- Versioning for future compatibility

## Technical Highlights

### Rate Limiting System
- IP-Based Rate Limiting:
  - Default: 100 requests/minute for most endpoints
  - Strict: 20 requests/minute for sensitive endpoints (auth)
  - Relaxed: 300 requests/minute for public endpoints (product listings)
- API Key-Based Rate Limiting:
  - Basic Tier: 100 requests/minute
  - Premium Tier: 300 requests/minute
  - Enterprise Tier: 1000 requests/minute
- Distributed Rate Limiting:
  - Redis-based for scalability
  - Fallback to memory store if Redis is unavailable

### Caching System
- Server-side Caching:
  - In-memory cache for frequently accessed data
  - Redis support for distributed environments
  - Automatic cache invalidation
  - TTL (Time To Live) for cache entries
- HTTP Caching:
  - Cache headers for static assets
  - Different policies for authenticated vs. unauthenticated routes

### Error Handling and Offline Support
- API Client with Retry Logic:
  - Automatic retry for failed requests
  - Exponential backoff
  - Offline detection
- Error Boundaries:
  - Global error boundary
  - Section-specific error boundaries
  - Custom fallback UIs
- Offline Detection:
  - Network status monitoring
  - Offline notification banner
  - Recovery notification

## Security Considerations
- Data encryption in transit (HTTPS) and at rest
- Secure authentication with JWT
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Regular security audits and updates

## Implementation Plan
1. Project setup and configuration
2. Database schema design and implementation
3. Backend API development
4. Authentication system implementation
5. Frontend development
6. Integration with third-party services
7. Testing and quality assurance
8. Deployment and monitoring setup

## Risk Assessment
- Integration challenges with payment and shipping APIs
- Scalability concerns with increasing user base
- Security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies
- Performance issues with large product catalogs
- User adoption and engagement challenges

## Success Metrics
- User registration and retention rates
- Transaction volume and value
- Platform uptime and performance
- Customer satisfaction ratings
- Farmer sales growth
